This is a mod for the "can you beat game X without killing anyone" challenge.

If the player kills anything (PRI logicwise), the player will die/fade out.

# how to install
Download CTGameNoKills.u from the Releases.

Put the file into ..\Star Wars Republic Commando\GameData\System folder

Once ingame, open console and load the map with new subgamemode.

For example: open GEO_01A?game=CTGameNoKills.CTGameNoKills

The mod will be kept loaded on level restart/transitions until you go back to main menu or restart the whole game.
